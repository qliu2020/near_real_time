To run the user interface:  
1. Open the 'UI.mlapp' file
2. Click the 'Open File' button and select the 'UI_data' file generated by 'System.m'  
3. Press the 'Pause/Play' button to start and press it again to stop.
   * Since the user interface will run synchronously with the data processing system in the future, it will wait the same amount of time as the system takes to finish the calibration before starting to display.  
4. Select the data to be observed in the drop box below
